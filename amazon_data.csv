MedicMommy,"Good product, fair price",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phone, good condition. The only thing that I would have liked included was a lightning cable wall plug that supports the newer smaller charger that works best with this phone. Overall I am very satisfied.",0.45625

Margaret Phelps,Perfect!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived sooner than expected. I set up myself with my old phone. The condition is perfect I would have never known it isnâ€™t new. Loving the long battery life and camera features.  I would purchases this way again.,0.281060606
Elizabeth,Phone is fine. Amazon is dishonest.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While this phone is fine, Amazon told me in writing I could purchase Apple Care for the device. I learned at Apple this is not the case. Also, Amazon says this is not sold by Amazon but a third party. The way these renewed devices are sold is completely misleading as they are sold under the ""Amazon Renewed Store"" - be mindful Amazon passes off their responsibility by saying they're not the seller. Buyer beware!",0.180555556
Todd Vriesenga,Does not play well with Verizon,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased two of these phones for my daughters for Christmas. For the last three days weâ€™ve been working with Verizon.Seller of this product does not give you any information about it.Verizon claims that these are not legitimate serial numbers.Probably going to have to return these phones.Messaged the seller and they are radio silent. Find a better solution because this is not a good path.,0.0375
Cratered,Just Wait...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had iPhones since #2, the 14 Pro is the worst experience I've had, yes the disappearing wallpaper bug is trivial but such amateur coding errors make me want to scream... A far BIGGER problem is the fact that for the first time ever in the history of me owning iPhones, this is first to attempt to regularly kill itself... Literally randomly bricking itself overnight for no reason other than what I can only assume are dire processor exceptions. You'll learn a lot about bizarre button combinations and laptop connections wayyyy beyond the regular hard reset in order to recover this phone from its self-inflicted coma... just don't bother, wait for the next iteration. Bionic? No chronic...",-0.079166667
motees,Stunning cell phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Pro is a spectacular iPhone.
(Max too big for me.)
Fast, smooth screen.
Beautiful videos and photos.
Increased brightness a big plus in bright sunshine. Full brightness almost too bright in regular light.
Used 2 x eSIMs only. Fine. Very easy conversion from my SIM card.
The vastly improved cameras may be overkill for non-professionals. Doesn't bother me. Great cameras either way. Could use higher optical zoom though.
Dynamic Island kind of cool but could live without it.
Satellite emergency calls without cell service may be fantastic for those who travel outside service areas. I'll probably never need it. Free currently but will probably cost in the future.
Crash Protection pretty cool---now that the false positives have been fixed (mostly, hopefully). Hopefully will never need this feature; but you never know!
Always on display does not use any significant battery due to the variable refresh rate down to 1 hz(!) I don't find it too useful. Maybe in time I will.
Get one!",0.261737374
John Plack,Price is a bit high,3.0 out of 5 stars,"T-mobile doesn't even sell this phone brand new for the price listed. I understand it has been renewed, but this will cost more than just buying one that has never been touched.",0.318181818
R. Marko,Worst IPhone I have ever had,1.0 out of 5 stars,The IPhone 14 pro is just awful! The reception inside buildings is bad. Where I had good reception before with my IPhone 11 Pro now can’t place or receive calls. The camera is constantly having problems with focus. Night pictures are a joke! Sometimes it will switch to night mode but most of the time not. I used to be able to use my IPhone 11 Pro to read extremely small print but on the 14 pro it is just always blurry. I have had a replacement sent to me but the same issues are on the replacement as well. The 2 pictures on this review are both night shots. The first one with my iPhone 11 Pro and the second with IPhone 14 pro. Both are taken at 11pm. The only good I can say about it is the battery life! It will last 2 days on a charge. I bought my phone from the Verizon store but I am so frustrated I am leaving a bad review where I can. Customers need to be aware of these issues!,-0.01328125
Michael Markey,My credit limit,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They increase my credit limit but Best Buy Visa card I got approved I got a 2,000 credit limit",0.03451
S. Olsen, Really bad iPhone 14 Pro,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have been unable to use this iPhone 14 Pro for much more than a paperweight nor can I reload the iPhone back to factory reset.,0.21453
HappyHiker,Perfect!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a scratch on it! It’s unlocked with no hidden hitches. Going from an 8 (yes, an 8, which I loved purely for the thumbprint reader—made life grand! lol) to a 14 Pro takes a little getting used to at first but very doable. I like the full screen too and the pictures are awesome, essentially on vibrant. Glad I got it!
Note: If you were with Straight Talk, TracFone, Boost or Metro and the like, if you try to leave them they would make it hard for you to leave by not giving you a code or port so that you can keep your same number, be persistent!",0.315674603
